					<h1> Roots</h1>

					<p> I decided to include the roots of my images and web links onto this page.  I assure you that none of the information attached to this website are borrowed except for the items on my menu.  That part I can say is my own design.  I want to give thanks to all the external web links and images used for this project as they made my web site visually appealing
